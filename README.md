Hi, I'm @johndpjr. I'm a young and passionate programmer that loves to challenge himself and learn new technologies. Currently, I am a high-level intermediate in Python and have a good grip on Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tkinter, sqlite3, and many more!

I'm currently learning C++ and working on some neat side-projects. I'm learning the theory behind operating systems, implementing data structures, and much more!

I am a Computer Science major at Texas A&M University with an expected graduation date in 2025.

You can reach me at my email: johndpowell02@gmail.com
