Hi, I'm @johndpjr. I'm a young and passionate programmer that loves to challenge himself and learn new technologies. Currently, I am a high-level intermediate in Python
and have a good grip on Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tkinter, sqlite3, and many more! I have beginner knowledge in Java (AP Computer Science A).

I'm interested in software development as well as artificial intelligence.

I'm currently learning C++ and working on some neat side-projects.
